                        Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of
                        this left scars on me."</li>

                        wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his
                        team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
                        for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields

                        American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
                        Mexico's wheat.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian

                    <li class="list-group-item "><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues
                        that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
                        land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
                        best breeds."</li>
